## About Me

Hi! I'm **Šimon Prokop**, a PhD researcher at **Brno University of Technology**, currently working in the areas of **autonomous robotics, UAVs, computer vision, and Visual-Inertial Odometry**.

My research focuses mainly on reliable state estimation and autonomous navigation for small aerial robots operating in **GNSS-denied environments**.

I am currently interested in combining classical geometric methods such as **Visual-Inertial Odometry / SLAM** with **adaptive and continual-learning approaches**.

## 🚀 Current Research

### Adaptive Visual-Inertial Odometry for UAVs

My current research investigates **robust Visual-Inertial Odometry for small multirotor UAVs** operating indoors and in GNSS-denied environments.

The goal is to develop and evaluate a real-time VIO pipeline capable of handling:

- fast UAV motion,
- rapid rotations,
- low-texture environments,
- motion blur,
- changing illumination,
- dynamic objects,
- limited onboard computational resources.

The system is primarily built around **OpenVINS**, ROS 2, synchronized camera + IMU measurements, and onboard embedded computing.

`OpenVINS` `ROS 2` `C++` `Python` `OpenCV` `Eigen` `Jetson`

### 🌿 UAV Tracking of Dynamic Objects

Another research direction explores autonomous UAV tracking of **moving and deformable objects**, such as tree branches affected by wind.

The project combines:

- VIO-based drone state estimation,
- visual object tracking,
- relative target pose estimation,
- adaptive control,
- continual learning.

The objective is to enable the drone to continuously adapt its motion while following a dynamically moving target.

### 📊 VIO Evaluation & Benchmarking Toolkit

I am also developing tools for evaluating Visual-Inertial Odometry algorithms using datasets such as **EuRoC MAV**.

The evaluation pipeline includes:

- Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE),
- Relative Pose Error (RPE),
- trajectory alignment,
- tracking success rate,
- runtime measurements,
- visualization,
- automatic experiment logging.

The goal is to create a simple and reproducible framework for comparing multiple VIO configurations and algorithms.
